::: {#hero-heading}
I am an Assistant Professor of International Commerce at Sogang University, where I teach courses in international economics, finance, and data science. My academic background includes a Ph.D. in Public Policy with a specialization in banking and central banking from the KDI School of Public Policy and Management.  

Previously, I served as an Assistant Professor of Economics at Woosong University, where I taught economics, research, and data science courses while mentoring students. My research focuses on central banking, financial stability, and banking supervision, with a particular interest in nonperforming loans, monetary policy communication, and sustainable central banking.  

Before transitioning to academia, I worked as a financial analyst at the National Bank of Ukraine, where I conducted financial modeling, risk analysis, and policy development. My expertise includes macro-financial surveillance, economic forecasting, and policy analysis. I have published research in reputable academic journals, contributing to discussions on banking regulation, financial market volatility, and monetary policy transparency.  

Beyond research, I am passionate about integrating data science into economics and finance. I teach students how to apply programming languages such as R and Python to analyze economic and financial data. I am also actively engaged in bridging the gap between research and policy by developing analytical tools for macroeconomic and financial analysis.
